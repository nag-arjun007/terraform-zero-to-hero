# terraform-zero-to-hero
If we want to do any ec2 we can login into console and do manually but if we want to do that for 50 EC2's then we can use terraform, mainly used for IAC, if we want to provision anything we need to done that by programming instead of manually, where we can use AWS CLI or through scripting we can talk to AWS API's (in our case provider is AWS). Suppose we can write in python language but main problem is we need to learn python. If we want to do lot of things in AWS like VPC+VPC config+EC2+S3 as endpoint to VPC for this we need good programming language. So, providers came with solution like you can write in JSON/YAML(Templates) we can take care the burden(Providers), AWS (Cloud Formation Templates), Azure (resource manager), Open stack (Heat template) IAC then why terraform. Suppose in one project they are using AWS, in another project they are using Azure how many tools you can learn and for tools CFT etc in providers need some scripting, so terraform saw this then terraform came with solution tell what provider to use like AWS, Azure etc. How to write? HCL and competitor for terraform is crossplane, pulumi etc terraform use internally API as code, whatever we write in HCL terraform will see what is provider will mention by us and talk to API's of that provider
